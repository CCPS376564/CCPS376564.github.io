    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working for a life that I can relax during and enjoy while still being able to be stable enough to go on occasional trips. The experiences that led me here are ones such as life during Covid and the lockdown and dealing with the first year in high school.

I am working towards these goals by working to gain more experience and getting my bachelors degree because that will make me more likely to get hired. I am also working to become physically stronger in case I want to have a hands on job.

 Some values that I consider very important is to not overwork yourself always find some time to relax in some way. I also try to stay as neutral as possible and do my own thing.

Some short-term goals that I hope to accomplish is to get physically stronger. I also want to save enough money to be able to move out.

I want to be known for my skill to adapt and learn new things very fast. And I want to be known for have some sort of creative accomplishment.</p>
